          <h2>What are deepfakes?</h2>
          <p>Deepfakes are media files, often videos or images, generated or heavily modified using machine learning models. They can make a person appear to say or do things they never actually said or did.</p>
          <p>Modern systems can mimic voices, facial expressions, and even subtle movements, making synthetic content feel surprisingly natural at first glance.</p>

          <ul class="info-list">
            <li>They can spread misinformation and influence opinions during sensitive moments such as elections or crises.</li>
            <li>They can be used for harassment, identity abuse, or reputational harm by placing people in fabricated scenarios.</li>
            <li>They can erode trust in real recordings, making it harder to believe genuine evidence.</li>
            <li>They can overload people with confusing content, leading to fatigue and disengagement.</li>

          <h2>How to stay safe</h2>
          <ul class="info-list">
            <li>Pause before sharing. Ask where the media came from and who benefits if it spreads.</li>
            <li>Look for visual inconsistencies such as unnatural lighting, warped backgrounds, or flickering details.</li>
            <li>Listen for audio glitches, robotic intonation, or mismatched lip movements in videos.</li>
            <li>Cross-check with trusted sources or official accounts before accepting dramatic claims.</li>
            <li>Use tools like Deepfake Shield as one data point, not the only decision maker.</li>

          <h2>Healthy skepticism, not panic</h2>
          <p>Deepfakes are part of a broader wave of generative media. Developing healthy skepticism, media literacy, and slow sharing habits can go a long way.</p>
          <p>Technology can assist by surfacing patterns and anomalies, but human judgment, context, and empathy remain essential in deciding what to trust and how to respond.</p>
